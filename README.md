# Universitary_glosary
This repository contains all my notes for each assignature on my Universitary period. You can find notes about:
* Data Structures
* Advanced Data Structures
* Operations investigation
* Advanced Operations investigations
* Data Bases
* Data Bases - Workshop
* FEP (Formulation of Informatic Projects)
* FEP 2 (Formulation of Informatic Projects - Workshop)
* Artificial intelligence
* Humans Factors on Software Projects
* Customer Experience

This idea has the intention to reduce the contamination provocated by the student using a lot of books to redact the homeworks and ther notes. Any dudes or correction you can do
it on the repository, and also on my email gonzalotello79@gmail.com :)
